# GP regression in BS

These scripts are meant to replicate the procedures described in ANONYMOUS PAPER (Rastogi 2017, to be made public in March/April 2017).
 
As usual: _caveat emptor_ (buyer beware). As the license says, while you are free to use the scripts as you please, I am not liable for anything that happens as a result of using my scripts :-). 

The scripts are technically the intellectual properties of EPFL and Riken-AIP group, which have both been kind enough to allow their redistribution under the liberal BSD-3 license (acting through Prof. Marilyne Andersen at EPFL and Prof. Masashi Sugiyama / Dr M. Emtiyaz Khan at Riken-AIP).

If you have questions or concerns, or notice errors, please contact me at rastogi.epfl@gmail.com .

Happy regressing!
