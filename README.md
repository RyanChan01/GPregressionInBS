# BSregression

As usual: _caveat emptor_ (buyer beware). As the license says, while you are free to use the scripts as you please, I am not liable for anything that happens as a result of using my scripts :-). Also, the scripts are technically the intellectual properties of EPFL, which has been kind enough to allow their redistribution under the liberal BSD-3 license (acting through Prof. Marilyne Andersen).

If you have questions or concerns, or notice errors, please contact me at contact@paragrastogi.com .

Happy regressing!
