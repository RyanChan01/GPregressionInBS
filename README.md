# GP regression in BS

These scripts are meant to replicate the procedures described in: Rastogi, Parag, Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan, and Marilyne Andersen. 2017. “Gaussian-Process-Based Emulators for Building Performance Simulation.” In _Proceedings of BS 2017_. San Francisco, CA, USA: IBPSA.
 
As usual: _caveat emptor_ (buyer beware). As the license says, while you are free to use the scripts as you please, I am not liable for anything that happens as a result of using my scripts :-). 

The scripts are the intellectual property of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Riken-AIP group, which have both allowed their redistribution under the BSD-3 license (acting through Prof. Marilyne Andersen at EPFL and Prof. Masashi Sugiyama / Dr Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan at Riken-AIP).

If you have questions or concerns, or notice errors, please contact me at rastogi.epfl@gmail.com .

Happy regressing!
